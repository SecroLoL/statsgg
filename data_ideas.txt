Ideas for machine learning/general applications of statsgg:
Winrate for each champion
Most popular picks 
Maybe include a trivia section since we have all this information? Could be educational ;)

Most popular summoner spells on each champion 
Which champions are most popular (champion picks/ (entries/10)) for pick-rate.
Average stats for each champion
Average gold for each champion
Match your stats against the average for each champion
First items to buy

Which champions die the most in their games(it's Master Yi that comes in first place, while Yuumi comes in last)
Brand dies the second-most :)
Which champions get the most kills, deaths, damagedealt, goldEarned, CS?

To get data for cross-referencing champions in accordance with each other, take games by chunksize 10 for 10 champs per game


Quirky stats!
Which keys to put summoner spells on (flash on d is more popular, but flash on f has a higher win-rate) 
What is the best summoner spell by winrate? (hint: it's 13 by a long-shot)
